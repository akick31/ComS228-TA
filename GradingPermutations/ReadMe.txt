A program that randomly assigns grading groups to each TA. Once assigned a grading group, 
the user must go through every student alphaetically and counting out the number of students assigned to a specific 
group. For example, in Spring 2019 to start the semester the 10 hour TAs were assigned 27 students while the 20 hour
TAs were assigned 36 students. If a 10 hour TA was assigned group 1, they'd take the first 27 students alphabetically,
and so on. It'd be the same with a 20 hour TA, but instead 36 students. User must manually edit the code for number of
groups (TAs) and add each TA.
